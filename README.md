# White-paper: artificial neural networks and percolation (Part 2)
This code accompany the [article](https://manuneuro.github.io/EmmanuelCalvet//quantum,/crypto/2022/09/24/whitepaper-p2.html) published on my website, belonging to the serie: "White-paper: IA and crypto". 

# Installation
To run this code, only standard library like `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `time` are needed

# Content
This code contain three experiments, testing an ANN with various weights matrices initialization:
- Percolation transition analogy
- Seed impact on the percolation
- Simulation of the output / variance of weight relationship.
